## 1. Project Identity

**YardSync** — Bilingual (EN/ES) PWA for lawn care / field service contractors.
**Owner:** Jay Johnson, JNew Technologies, LLC (San Antonio, TX).
**Domain:** yardsyncapp.com (client-facing) + yardsync.vercel.app (admin/dev).
**Repo:** github.com/FanbaseTickets/yardsync (the GitHub org is "FanbaseTickets" — a legacy name from Jay's other project, not a mistake).
**Admin Firebase account:** admin@fanbasetickets.net
**Customer-facing email:** support@yardsyncapp.com

## 2. Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Details |
|---|---|
| SaaS subscription | $39/mo or $390/yr, billed via Stripe Checkout |
| Per-invoice fee | 5.5% application fee on every invoice, deducted at payment time via Stripe Connect destination charges |
| Pro Setup | $99 one-time add-on at signup — YardSync imports the contractor's client list manually |
| Volume rewards | $1,500+/mo invoiced for 2 consecutive months → 50% off subscription; $3,000+/mo → free subscription. The 5.5% fee always applies regardless of tier. |
| Early Adopter Lock | Accounts created before April 15, 2028 lock in 5.5% for life. Forfeited if: cancel >60 days, payment lapse >30 days, or downgrade. |

**Target market:** Hispanic lawn care operators. Geographic rollout: San Antonio → Houston → Dallas → Miami → LA.
**First customer:** Marco (Jay's personal gardener).

**Key business rule:** The 5.5% per-invoice fee is non-negotiable and always applies. The subscription fee is what gets discounted/waived via volume rewards. Marketing copy must never imply the platform is "free" without clarifying the per-invoice fee.

## 3. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15.3 (App Router), JavaScript only — no TypeScript |
| UI | Tailwind CSS, DM Sans + DM Serif Display fonts, lucide-react icons |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (client SDK only) |
| Database | Firebase Firestore (client SDK for reads, REST API for server writes) |
| Payments | Stripe Connect (Express), Stripe Checkout, Stripe webhooks |
| SMS | Twilio (A2P registered) |
| Email | SendGrid (@sendgrid/mail v8.1.6) |
| Hosting | Vercel (auto-deploy from main branch) |
| State | React useState/useEffect, no Redux/Zustand |

**Notable package.json artifacts:**
- `firebase-admin` is listed but CANNOT be used (org policy blocks it — see Section 5)
- `square` is listed but all Square functionality was removed April 2026. Routes exist as dead code.

```

### Auth Patterns
- **Stripe webhook:** Signature verification via `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()`
- **Square webhook:** HMAC-SHA256 (dead code, but still wired)
- **Cron routes:** `Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` header check
- **Admin API routes:** Firebase ID token verification via REST `accounts:lookup` against `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- **Other Stripe routes:** No server-side auth — rely on client-side Firebase auth gating via AppShell
- **Client pages:** `AppShell.js` checks subscription status + Stripe Connect status before rendering

### Key Libraries
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/firestoreRest.js` | Server-side Firestore via REST API. Signs in as admin (email/password → ID token). Exports: `queryCollection`, `getDocument`, `setDocument`, `updateDocument`, `createDocument`, `toFirestoreValue`, `fromFirestoreFields` |
| `lib/email.js` | SendGrid wrapper. Exports: `sendAdminEmail({ subject, html, text })`. Fails silently if env vars missing. |
| `lib/fee.js` | Fee math. `formatCents()` and application fee calculation (5.5%). |
| `lib/firebase.js` | Firebase client SDK init (app, auth, db exports). |
| `lib/phone.js` | Phone number formatting utilities. |
| `lib/date.js` | Date formatting with `fmt()` helper using date-fns. |
| `lib/i18n.js` | Bilingual string maps (EN/ES) for UI text. |
| `lib/square.js` | Square helpers (dead code, still imported by Square routes). |
| `lib/ical.js` | iCal generation for client schedule feeds. |
| `lib/db.js` | Firestore collection reference helpers. |

### Components
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `components/layout/AppShell.js` | Main app wrapper. Gates on: Firebase auth, subscription status, Stripe Connect status. Admin email bypasses subscription check. |
| `components/layout/BottomNav.js` | Mobile bottom navigation bar. |
| `components/layout/PageHeader.js` | Shared page header component. |
| `components/ui/PhoneInput.js` | Phone number input with formatting. |
| `components/ui/index.js` | UI component barrel export. |

### Contexts
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `context/AuthContext.js` | Firebase Auth provider. Exposes `user`, `loading`, `signOut`. |
| `context/LangContext.js` | EN/ES language toggle. Persists to localStorage. |

## 5. Critical Constraints

### The Firebase Admin SDK Problem
The Firebase project lives under the `fanbasetickets.net` Google Cloud organization. This org has a policy that blocks service account key creation. Without a service account key, `firebase-admin` cannot initialize. This is NOT fixable without org admin changes.

**Workaround:** `lib/firestoreRest.js` authenticates via Firebase Auth REST API:
1. Signs in with email/password → gets ID token
2. Caches token in memory (refreshes when expired, 60s buffer)
3. Uses token as Bearer auth for Firestore REST API calls
4. Required env vars: `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `FIREBASE_API_KEY`

**Impact:** All server-side writes (webhook handlers, invoice creation, admin routes) must use `firestoreRest.js` helpers, never direct Firebase Admin calls.

### SSR/Prerender Restrictions
Firebase client SDK requires browser APIs. Any page that imports Firebase and is statically rendered at build time will crash the Vercel build.

**Affected routes that must NEVER import Firebase:**
- `app/(landing)/page.js` — marketing landing page
- `app/signup/page.js` — signup redirect

**Solutions:**
- `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` for Firebase components
- `'use client'` directive + no server component Firebase imports
- `useSearchParams()` requires Suspense boundary or use `window.location.search` in useEffect instead

### Domain Usage Rules
Both domains serve the same Vercel deployment:
- **yardsyncapp.com** — Use for contractor/client-facing URLs (payment links, template downloads, landing page, terms)
- **yardsync.vercel.app** — Use for admin-facing URLs (dashboard links in SMS/email alerts to Jay)

---

## 6. Stripe Integration Details

### Subscription Flow
1. Contractor visits `/subscribe` → picks monthly ($39) or annual ($390) + optional Pro Setup ($99)
2. `POST /api/stripe/checkout` creates a Checkout session with line items
3. Stripe redirects to success URL after payment
4. Webhook `checkout.session.completed` fires → writes to `subscriptions` and `users` collections
5. If Pro Setup was purchased (detected via `listLineItems` against `STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP`):
   - Sets `setupFeePaid: true` on user doc
   - Sends SMS to `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER` via Twilio
   - Sends branded HTML email to `ADMIN_EMAIL` via SendGrid
   - Admin sees pending widget on `/admin/dashboard`

### Invoice Flow (Stripe Connect)
1. Contractor marks job complete → taps "Send Invoice"
2. Confirmation modal shows: line items, 5.5% fee breakdown, net amount
3. `POST /api/stripe/invoice` creates PaymentIntent with `application_fee_amount` and `transfer_data.destination`
4. Invoice doc written to Firestore via `firestoreRest.js`
5. Client receives SMS/email with payment link → pays at `/pay/[paymentIntentId]`
6. Webhook `payment_intent.succeeded` marks invoice as paid in Firestore

### Subscription Lifecycle (webhook handlers)
| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Create subscription + user docs, detect Pro Setup |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | Renew subscription, mark Connect invoices paid |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Set status → `past_due` |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Update plan (monthly/annual) + status |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Set status → `canceled` |
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Mark Connect invoices paid |

### Invoice Double-Charge Prevention
Recurring clients with a prepaid plan must NOT be charged the base service fee again. The invoice modal:
- Detects recurring clients and excludes the base line item
- Shows only extras + materials
- Displays a note: "Base service is already covered by the recurring plan"

---

## 7. Admin Dashboard

Lives at `/admin/dashboard`. Dark mode UI. Only accessible to `admin@fanbasetickets.net`.

### Features
- Gardener (contractor) list with revenue stats
- Subscription status overview
- Invoice history per gardener
- **Pro Setup Pending Widget** (amber alert card at top):
  - Filters: `gardeners.filter(g => g.setupFeePaid && !g.setupContacted)`
  - Shows count, most recent purchase, up to 5 entries
  - "Mark contacted" button opens modal with notes field
  - "Send template to client" button emails import template via `/api/admin/send-template`
  - "Download template" button downloads `/YardSync_Client_Import_Template.xlsx`

### Gardener Filter Chips (added April 13)
- All / Connect-complete / Needs Connect / No invoices yet / Top earners
- Connect-complete gates on `!!g.stripeAccountId` (NOT `stripeAccountStatus` — that field is poisoned)
- Default sort: `activeClients` descending
- Top earners: top 5 by `allTime.total` desc

### Dead UI to Remove (next session)
- Any Square-related UI elements
- Quarterly billing references
- These were from the pre-April 2026 dual-payment-path era

---

## 8. Bilingual System (EN/ES)

- `context/LangContext.js` provides `lang` and `setLang`
- `lib/i18n.js` contains all translated strings
- Toggle available in the app UI
- Landing page has its own inline Spanish toggle
- SMS messages sent via Twilio respect the contractor's language preference
- All filter chips, buttons, modals, and helper text have Spanish translations

---

## 9. Project Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1-3 (Pre-March 2026)
- Initial build: Firebase + Square payment path
- Calendar with job management
- Client list, services, materials tracking
- SMS appointment reminders via Twilio

### Phase 4 (March 2026)
- Added Stripe Connect as parallel payment option alongside Square
- Dual payment path: contractors chose Square OR Stripe during onboarding
- Quarterly billing cron for Square invoices
- Master codebase snapshot V1 and V2 generated

### Phase 5 (April 2026) — Current
- **Square fully removed** — migrated to Stripe-only model
- Square routes preserved as dead code (files not deleted)
- Quarterly billing crons disabled (return early)
- Rewrote Terms of Service for dual-fee model ($39/mo sub + 5.5% per invoice)
- Added Early Adopter Pricing Lock (Section 5 of ToS)
- Marketing landing page at `/` with phone screenshots, volume rewards, pricing cards
- Landing page iterations: hero copy, screenshot versions (v1→v4), mint green background
- Collapsible job cards on calendar with filter chips (All/Pending/Completed/Set Route)
- Drag-and-drop route reordering (pointer events, touch + mouse)
- Invoice confirmation modal with fee breakdown
- Recurring invoice safety: never charges prepaid base service
- Materials included in walk-in invoice totals
- Pro Setup admin notification chain: Stripe webhook → Twilio SMS + SendGrid email → dashboard widget
- Client import template hosting + email API
- Firebase Auth verification on admin API routes
- Contact email unified to support@yardsyncapp.com

### Phase 5 continued (April 13, 2026)
- Null-guarded `subscription.current_period_end` in two webhook handlers (checkout + invoice.payment_succeeded)
- `currentPeriodEnd` + `lastPaymentAt` written to users doc on every payment; displayed on Settings
- Calendar auto-selects today on load (was showing empty state requiring tap)
- Landing page: "FREE" → "$0 Subscription" everywhere, Early Adopter banner added above pricing
- Email invoice notifications: `sendClientEmail()` in `lib/email.js`, server-side bilingual email with pay link
- Walk-in default price set to $65 (was empty placeholder causing $0 invoices)
- Settings "$0/mo" wording (was "FREE")
- **Channel picker on all invoice send paths** — SMS / Email / Both buttons based on client contact info
- `preferredChannel` field on client doc, radio group in Edit Client modal
- Invoice API accepts `channels` param, returns `emailNotified` + `smsRequested`
- Bug A fixed: Edit Client phone clearing (`form.phone || client.phone` → `form.phone.trim()`)
- Bug B fixed: Silent 400 on Send Invoice → specific error codes (`no_connect`, `no_total`) + graceful toast + redirect to Settings
- Bug D fixed: Phone no longer marked required, "Phone or email required" helper, form-level validation
- Bug E fixed: "undefined · active" → "No package · active" on clients without a package
- Sign-out: labeled pill on dashboard hero + full-width button on Settings bottom
- Admin dashboard: gardener filter chips (All / Connect-complete / Needs Connect / No invoices / Top earners) + activeClients sort
- Connect-complete filter gates on `stripeAccountId` (not poisoned `stripeAccountStatus`)

### Phase 5 continued (April 14, 2026)
- i18n hotfix: `common.sign_out` key added (EN + ES) so dashboard pill and Settings button render "Sign out" / "Cerrar sesión" instead of raw key
- Bug C fully closed: all 4 Connect-complete gates (AppShell, dashboard onboarding step, 2× Settings) now check `!!profile.stripeAccountId` instead of poisoned `stripeAccountStatus`
- Deleted `scripts/migrate-stripe-status.js` (the poisoner) and added `scripts/clean-orphaned-stripe-status.js` (one-shot cleanup)
- **Ran cleanup**: 6 orphaned `stripeAccountStatus: 'complete'` docs cleared (test accounts + Marco's account which hadn't finished Connect onboarding)
- Deleted duplicate Victor Scales Firestore doc (`znCfJTyyScZchNOqNESL9CmvqQy1`) that conflicted with the real account having 8 clients
- **Bug D finished on Add-Client modal**: phone optional, email format validation, "Did you mean?" suggestions for common typos (gmial/gmai/yaho/etc)
- New `lib/emailHelpers.js` exports `isValidEmail` + `suggestEmailCorrection`
- **Bug F Part A (admin tally)**: `splitInvoice()` now trusts top-level `inv.applicationFee` + `inv.totalCents` before falling back to legacy line-item walk — destination-charge invoices were showing $0 platform fee in admin tallies
- **Bug F Part B (recent invoices row)**: replaced duplicate inline walker with `splitInvoice()` call so per-gardener Recent Invoices list shows correct "My cut / Gardener kept" breakdown
- **Admin Dashboard Overhaul PR 1** (layout only): top-line collapsed from 8 → 6 cards in 2x3 (My Cut + Collected show realized headline + committed subtitle, Active Contractors, Active Clients, Subscription Mix with MRR, Pro Setup Pending). Removed Quarterly Fee Breakdown, standalone MRR, and top-line Outstanding. Added Attention panel (renders only when populated: Connect disabled / past_due / canceled <30d / going dark). Per-row tier badge (Sub: Monthly/Annual/Inactive/Other). Expanded row gains Outstanding card.
- **Admin Dashboard Overhaul PR 2** (Q11 Stripe net-out): webhook `payment_intent.succeeded` now captures `pi.latest_charge.balance_transaction.fee` and persists `stripeProcessingFee` + `netToPlatform` on the invoice doc. Dashboard `splitInvoice()` prefers `netToPlatform` when present, so new paid invoices report true YardSync net (app fee minus Stripe's ~2.9% + $0.30) instead of gross. Corrects ~50%+ revenue overstatement on dashboard headline as new invoices flow.

### Phase 5 continued (April 20-21, 2026)
- Privacy policy: added mobile opt-in language for A2P compliance (never share SMS data with third parties)
- Webhook hardening: `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted` now log warnings instead of failing silently when `subscriptions` doc lookup returns null
- One-shot backfill `scripts/backfill-user-subscription-fields.js` — 7 test accounts backfilled with `stripeSubscriptionId`, `currentPeriodEnd`, `lastPaymentAt`; 4 unbackfillable orphans flagged
- Settings "Last charged" + "Next billing date" now render for backfilled accounts
- **Volume Rewards system fully verified end-to-end (Tier 0 item CLOSED):**
  - `reward-check` cron fixed: now looks up `stripeAccountId` via Firestore (was relying on unreliable metadata writes from `save-account-metadata`)
  - Persists `rewardTier`, `rewardStreak`, `lastVolumeCheck`, `lastVolumeAmount` to user doc on every run
  - Stripe flexible-billing compatibility: uses `discounts: [{ coupon }]` instead of legacy `coupon` param; uses `deleteDiscount()` for removal (`update({ discounts: [] })` silently no-ops)
  - Settings Pay Rewards widget rewritten to read authoritative `profile.rewardTier` / `rewardStreak` instead of computing from local invoices
  - "🏆 Free tier active" / "⭐ 50% reward active" badges on subscription card
  - "Upgrade to Annual" card now hidden when any reward tier is active (math was misleading at 50% off, nonsensical at free)
  - "Volume / You Pay" column headers added to Pay Rewards widget
  - Seed script (`scripts/seed-volume-reward-test.js`) uses destination charges to mirror production flow
  - Coupons `YARDSYNC_50OFF` (50% forever) and `YARDSYNC_FREE` (100% forever) created in Stripe test mode
  - All 5 scenarios visually verified on Victor Scales test account (half tier, free tier, streak building at each, base state)

## 10. Deployment Breakers (Historical)

These are real errors that crashed production or blocked deployment. Documented so they never happen again.

### 1. Firebase imports in prerendered routes
**Error:** `ReferenceError: document is not defined` during Vercel build
**Cause:** `app/(landing)/page.js` imported `useAuth` from `@/context/AuthContext`, which imports Firebase client SDK. The landing page is statically rendered at build time — Firebase needs browser APIs.
**Fix:** Remove all Firebase imports from landing page and signup page. (Commits: 61a9152)

### 2. useSearchParams without Suspense
**Error:** Vercel build crash — "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary"
**Cause:** `app/login/page.js` used `useSearchParams()` at the top level.
**Fix:** Replaced with `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` inside useEffect. (Commit: 4f778d6)

### 3. Firestore 403 PERMISSION_DENIED on server-side writes
**Error:** Webhook and invoice routes returned 500 — Firestore rejected writes.
**Cause:** Attempted to use Firebase Admin SDK, which can't initialize due to org policy.
**Fix:** Created `lib/firestoreRest.js` — authenticates via Firebase Auth REST API, uses Firestore REST for all server writes.

### 4. new Date(NaN).toISOString() crash in webhook
**Error:** `RangeError: Invalid time value` — webhook returned 500
**Cause:** `subscription.current_period_end` is null/undefined on certain Stripe events. `new Date(undefined * 1000)` = `new Date(NaN)`.
**Fix:** Null-guard: `value ? new Date(value * 1000).toISOString() : null`. Fixed in two places. (Commits: 9df0eb5, bdc5b8f)

### 5. Pro Setup flag written on every checkout
**Error:** Every subscriber was showing up in the Pro Setup pending widget, not just those who paid $99.
**Cause:** During the firestoreRest migration, the `hasSetup` line item check was accidentally stripped. `setupFeePaid: true` was being written for ALL checkout.session.completed events.
**Fix:** Re-added `listLineItems` check against `STRIPE_PRICE_SETUP`, wrapped all setup writes + alerts in `if (hasSetup)`. (Commit: fe64910)
**Cleanup needed:** Audit `users` collection for stale `setupFeePaid: true` flags from the bug period.

### 6. Card component swallowing data attribute for drag-and-drop
**Error:** Desktop drag-and-drop stopped working — drop target couldn't find `data-schedule-id`.
**Cause:** React component consumed the data attribute instead of passing it to the DOM.
**Fix:** Wrapped card in a div carrying `data-schedule-id`. (Commit: 9ca7bdb)

### 7. Walk-in materials cost not included in invoice total
**Error:** Invoice preview showed wrong total — materials were missing from the calculation.
**Cause:** Walk-in invoice total was calculated from a separate code path that didn't include materials.
**Fix:** Added materials to `walkInInvoiceTotal` calculation. (Commit: baec4e7)

### 8. Edit Client silently preserves phone on blank submit
**Error:** Clearing a client's phone in Edit modal, saving, then reloading — phone reappears unchanged.
**Cause:** `phone: form.phone || client.phone` treats empty string as falsy, falls back to old value.
**Fix:** `phone: form.phone.trim()` — empty string means "clear the field". (Commit: 820cd5a)

### 9. Silent 400 on Send Invoice without Stripe Connect
**Error:** Contractor clicks Send Invoice, nothing happens — no toast, no error, modal stays open.
**Cause:** `/api/stripe/invoice` returned 400 with generic "Missing required fields", client threw but the toast was swallowed.
**Fix:** API returns specific `code: 'no_connect'`, client shows descriptive toast + redirects to Settings. (Commit: 820cd5a)

### 11. Admin "My cut" tally read $0 on destination-charge invoices
**Error:** Admin dashboard's per-gardener fee tally, top-line cards, and Recent Invoices rows all showed $0 for every Stripe Connect destination-charge invoice.
**Cause:** `splitInvoice()` derived fees from `lineItems.filter(l => l.category === 'fee')`, but `/api/stripe/invoice` writes `applicationFee` as a top-level field and never injects a fee line item. Two separate places had this inline walker.
**Fix:** Part A — `splitInvoice()` now prefers `inv.applicationFee` + `inv.totalCents` top-level (commit a3e2949). Part B — duplicate inline walker in Recent Invoices row replaced with `splitInvoice()` call (commit f04c003). Legacy line-item walk kept as fallback for the one Marco Rubio legacy invoice.

### 12. i18n sign_out key missing from common namespace
**Error:** Dashboard hero pill and Settings button rendered literal `sign_out` text instead of translated label.
**Cause:** `translate('common', 'sign_out')` called but key only existed under `subscribe` namespace.
**Fix:** Added `common.sign_out` to both EN ("Sign out") and ES ("Cerrar sesión") blocks (commit 5bd5eb3).

### 13. Connect-complete UI gated on poisoned stripeAccountStatus
**Error:** AppShell let contractors through to protected routes even without Connect onboarding (6 of 16 user docs had `stripeAccountStatus: 'complete'` but no `stripeAccountId`).
**Cause:** A one-shot migration script stamped `stripeAccountStatus: 'complete'` on subscribed users regardless of actual Stripe Connect status.
**Fix:** All 4 Connect-complete gates (AppShell redirect, dashboard onboarding step, 2× Settings sections) now gate on `!!profile.stripeAccountId`. Poisoner script deleted. Cleanup script ran and cleared 6 orphans. (Commits 39a049e)

### 10. Walk-in default price creating $0 invoices
**Error:** Contractors see "65" as a grey placeholder, submit without touching field, `walkInPrice === ''` → `basePrice = 0`.
**Cause:** Placeholder is not a value — `useState('')` initializes empty.
**Fix:** Initialize `walkInPrice` to `'65'` in both `openWalkInForClient` and `openWalkInModal`. (Commit: 79c7472)

## 12. Testing Reference

- **Admin login:** admin@fanbasetickets.net
- **Test contractor account:** Jay uses a "victor" account for Stripe flow testing (must log out of admin first)
- **Stripe test connected account:** acct_1TIdSq1wen7Bjvpl (rub@test.com)
- **Webhook testing:** Resend events from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → select event → Resend
- **Vercel logs:** Check function logs for webhook debug output (console.log lines throughout webhook handler)
- **QA checklist:** `QA_PHASE5_CHECKLIST.md` — comprehensive test plan for all features

## 13. Known Technical Debt

1. **`firebase-admin` in package.json** — listed but can't be used. Should remove to avoid confusion.
2. **`square` in package.json** — listed but all Square functionality removed. Square routes exist as dead code.
3. **`firestoreRest.js:22` fallback email** — `admin@fanbasetickets.net` hardcoded as fallback. Should fail loudly if `FIREBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL` not set.
4. **`firestore.rules:5`** — `isAdmin()` hardcodes `admin@fanbasetickets.net`. Works but fragile.
5. **19 Stripe API routes have no server-side auth** — rely entirely on client-side AppShell gating. Low risk for now (all require Stripe customer IDs that aren't guessable) but worth hardening before scale.
6. **Admin dashboard still has some Square-era UI** — scheduled for cleanup.
7. ~~**Landing page "FREE Subscription" wording**~~ — RESOLVED: all "FREE" → "$0 Subscription" with "5.5% per invoice always applies" (commit 15cdb4d).
8. ~~**No Early Adopter deadline on landing page**~~ — RESOLVED: banner added above pricing (commit 15cdb4d).
9. **Duplicate invoice prevention is client-side only** — racy under concurrent requests. Consider Firestore transaction guard.
10. ~~**`stripeAccountStatus` poisoned in Firestore**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-04-14: All 6 orphans cleared via `scripts/clean-orphaned-stripe-status.js`. Poisoner script deleted.
11. ~~**AppShell Connect gate is weak**~~ — RESOLVED 2026-04-14: All 4 Connect gates now check `!!profile.stripeAccountId` (commit 39a049e).
12. **Historical invoices lack `stripeProcessingFee`** — Q11 captures this going forward via webhook, but pre-April 14 paid invoices have no processing-fee data. Dashboard shows gross for those, net for new ones. Acceptable — gap closes naturally as new invoices flow. Optional backfill script if accounting wants exact historical numbers.
13. **Three dead inline line-item walkers remain** in `app/admin/dashboard/page.js` (lines ~138, ~156, ~214) — obsolete quarterly-billing code. Low priority cleanup.

### Post-launch
- [ ] `/invoices` index page (currently "coming soon" toast)
- [ ] Server-side duplicate invoice enforcement
- [ ] Reactivation path full testing (cancel → reactivate cycle)
- [ ] Remove dead Square routes + `square` package
- [ ] Remove `firebase-admin` from package.json
- [ ] Consider server-side auth on Stripe API routes

## 15. Session Update Protocol

**At the end of every significant session, update this file:**
1. Add any new deployment breakers to Section 10
2. Update the timeline in Section 9 with what was built
3. Move completed roadmap items out of Section 14
4. Update Section 13 (tech debt) if anything was added or resolved
5. Update the "Last updated" date at the top

**This file replaces the need to:**
- Re-explore the codebase
- Re-read git history
- Ask "what does this project do?"
- Re-discover constraints the hard way
